            <ul>
                <li>Michael Schumacher (; German: ['m?ça??e?l '?u?max?] (listen); born 3 January 1969) is a retired
                    German racing driver who raced in Formula One for Jordan Grand Prix, Benetton and Ferrari, where he
                    spent most of his career, as well as for Mercedes upon his return to the sport.</li>
                <li>Widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers ever, and regarded by some as the
                    greatest of all time, Schumacher is the only driver in history to win seven Formula One World
                    Championships, five of which he won consecutively.</li>
                <li>The most successful driver in the history of the sport, Schumacher holds the records for the most
                    World Championship titles (7), the most Grand Prix wins (91), the most fastest laps (77) and the
                    most races won in a single season (13), and according to the official Formula One website
                    (Formula1.com), Schumacher was "statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen" at the
                    time of his retirement from the sport.After success in karting as a child, Schumacher won titles in
                    Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship.</li>
                <li>In 1991 his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being
                    signed by Benetton for the rest of that season.
                    He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, before becoming the first German World Drivers'
                    Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill, albeit in controversial circumstances.</li>
                <li>In 1995 he repeated the success, this time with a greater margin.</li>
                <li>In 1996 Schumacher moved to Ferrari, who had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979, and helped
                    them transform into the most successful team in Formula One history, as he came close to winning the
                    1997 and 1998 titles, before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, ending another title
                    run. Schumacher won five consecutive drivers' titles from 2000 to 2004, including an unprecedented
                    sixth and seventh title.</li>
                <li>In 2002 Schumacher won the title with a record six races remaining and finished on the podium in
                    every race.
                    In 2004 Schumacher won twelve out of the first thirteen races and went on to win a record 13 times
                    as he won his final title.</li>
                <li>Schumacher retired from Formula One in 2006, after finishing runner-up to Renault's Fernando Alonso.
                </li>
                <li>Schumacher returned to Formula One in 2010 with Mercedes.</li>
                <li>He produced the fastest qualifying time at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix, and achieved his only podium
                    on his return at the 2012 European Grand Prix, where he finished third.</li>
                <li>In October 2012 Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time at the end of the season.
